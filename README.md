# Improving the Analysis of Malicious Websites using Machine Learning

## Objectives

The extension, powered by a machine learning model, aims to:

- **Identify Malicious Websites**: Determine if the visited site is harmful due to:
  - Phishing
  - Malware
  - Adware or other downloads
  
- **Inform the User**: Provide insights into:
  - The type of website visited
  - The originating website if the user is being tracked
  - The website the user might have intended to visit
  
- **Transparency**: Explain why the model flagged the website, offering specific indicators that triggered the decision.
  
- **Intelligent Redirection**: Automatically guide users to their intended website, correcting for mistypes or errors.

- **Enhanced Privacy**: Block all tracking requests from flagged websites to ensure user privacy across searches.

## What Makes This Different?

### Conventional Solutions
1. Rely primarily on known databases of harmful URLs.
2. Limited explanation or context for why a site is harmful.
3. Rarely offer redirection to safer alternatives.

### Our Approach
1. **Comprehensive Identification**: Uses machine learning for real-time analysis, covering a wide range of threats.
2. **Descriptive Analysis**: Goes beyond binary safe/unsafe indicators to provide contextual information.
3. **User Tracking & Target Demographics**: Provides additional layers of information for a nuanced understanding.
4. **Intelligent Redirection**: Not just flagging, but also guiding users to safer alternatives.
5. **Enhanced Privacy Features**: Blocks tracking requests, offering users a safer browsing experience.

By combining machine learning with user-friendly design, we aim to offer a tool that not only protects but also educates and empowers users to navigate the web safely.
