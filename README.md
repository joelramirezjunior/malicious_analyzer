# Enhancing Web Security through Machine Learning-Based Analysis of Malicious Websites

## Project Objectives

This innovative browser extension is engineered to bolster web security by utilizing a sophisticated machine learning model to analyze and identify potential threats on websites in real-time. The core objectives of this extension are to:

- **Detect Malicious Websites**: Automatically evaluates each accessed website to ascertain potential risks, identifying threats like phishing, malware, and intrusive adware.

- **User Notification**: Delivers comprehensive insights on detected threats, elucidating the type of malicious activities identified and the rationale behind the website's classification.

- **Decision Transparency**: Provides a clear exposition of the factors and indicators analyzed, offering users a deeper understanding of the assessment outcomes.

- **Proactive User Guidance**: Facilitates safer web navigation by suggesting redirection away from harmful sites towards safer alternatives.

- **Privacy Assurance**: Enhances user privacy by obstructing tracking attempts from dubious sources, thereby safeguarding user data and anonymity.

## Distinctive Features

### Traditional Methods
1. Rely predominantly on static databases for threat identification.
2. Offer scant or no explanation regarding the security evaluations.
3. Do not support user redirection to safer web alternatives.

### Our Innovative Approach
1. **Dynamic Threat Identification**: Employs an advanced, real-time machine learning model to discern a wide array of online threats, enhancing detection capabilities.
2. **In-depth Threat Analysis**: Provides detailed explanations for a website's risk assessment, granting users clarity and insight.
3. **Informative User Experience**: Shares detailed information about potential tracking and the website's history, boosting user knowledge and decision-making.
4. **Smart Navigation Assistance**: Actively suggests safer browsing alternatives, promoting user safety.
5. **Robust Privacy Protection**: Blocks tracking technologies on suspect sites, reinforcing the user's digital privacy.

This extension is crafted to be an active web security tool, distinguishing threats while educating users, thereby fostering a safer and more informed browsing experience.

## Extension Architecture and Communication Flow

### Architectural Overview

The extension integrates several key components that collaboratively analyze and act upon web content:

- **Content Script (`content.js`)**: Engages directly with the webpage, extracting HTML and pertinent data for subsequent analysis.

- **Background Script (`background.js`)**: Operates as the message orchestration center, coordinating interactions between the content script, popup interface, and external model prediction servers.

- **Popup Script (`popup.js`)**: Offers a user interface that displays real-time analysis results and facilitates user interaction with the extension's functionalities.

### Communication Model

1. **User Interface to Background**: Upon user interaction with the extension popup, `popup.js` communicates with `background.js` to request the current or a new analysis for the active webpage.

2. **Background to Content Script**: `background.js` dispatches the analysis request to `content.js`, instructing it to collate and forward the webpage's content or to initiate a fresh analysis.

3. **Content Script to Server Interaction**: `content.js` consults the machine learning model server via API, transmitting the webpage data, receiving the analysis, and subsequently relaying this data back to `background.js`.

4. **Background to User Interface**: `background.js` conveys the analytical findings to `popup.js`, which then updates the UI to present the analysis results to the user.

## Insights on Feature Extraction

The feature extraction phase is foundational to the analysis process, targeting key words and structural elements within the webpage content. Initially anchored in a set of predefined parameters, this process is designed to evolve through continuous refinement and enhancement, informed by the model's feedback and adaptive learning. The ongoing development aims to augment the precision and relevance of the extracted features, thereby improving the analytical accuracy (refer to `feature_extractor.py` for the current implementation details).
