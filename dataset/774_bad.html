                        <p>He stands very proud! Most of the time! He is very shy and timid with strangers and strange places. But once he is familiar and comfortable he does much much better. He starts puppy classes on Tuesday! More so for socializing and the basic commands! I’m positive he will do wonderful! Yes, please use us as a reference! If you would like better pictures I am happy to send more! He is a true snuggler at heart. Rody loves his kisses and snuggles. He really is our cute Havanese baby!</p>

                        <p>Love Our Puppy, Not Sure we Loved Our Service <br>    

                        I will say we love our puppy!! Communication at first was fantastic and then it took awhile to get any answers from the them. We got nervous about them being legit, especially after we paid, but they got back in communication with us so we felt better. There were a few hiccups during the process but things were ironed out. Our puppy was about an hour late for drop off. When we opened her cage, our puppy smelled awful and looked and acted as if she came from a puppy mill. Our hearts sank as she was saturated in her own urine. We gave her a bath and took her to the vet. She tested positive for parasites and was sick for her first 2.5 weeks. Ronarld Chetty assured that the puppies are healthy before they’re re handed over but our little one was not. She is doing amazing now and we are so happy but the process was not as smooth as we expected. Everyone was friendly and answered questions for us when they were in communication, we did get a follow up call to switch ownership, so I gave them a 4. Photo attached is after her first groom. I will not post a before.</p>

                        Dean is a wonderful "companion" Puppy. I
                        was extremely concerned for Dean safety
                        during his travels, he is amazing, he
                        arrived in good condition. However during
                        his vet exam it was descovered she had
                        Giardia. After a week of meds it is gone.
                        Dean is a very good boy and he is really helping me to overcome my depression and disability…Thank you

                        <p>I Just wanted to let you know we are so incredibly in love with Angel!!! She is such a good girl and smart as all get out. She is loving life on the farm, and already trying out her herding skills on the cows, horses, chicken and cats. We never have her on a leash; she listens well and plays outside all day with us while we work about. People give good comments all the time whenever I take her out for a walk. Oh my God, am really glad.</p>

                        <p>Libby is a one of a kind sweet girl. She is very precious &amp; intelligent. She has developed a funny habit of sucking on my earlobe while she lays on her back &amp; lets me rub her belly. She is very outgoing &amp; friendly to everyone. She has gorgeous eyes &amp; she always gives you eye contact when you talk to her. I have never shown in a dog show but Libby is making me seriously consider it. She has such a big personality, that I think she would do well. Her coat is silky, soft &amp; THICK. I can tell she is going to be gorgeous. To anyone who is contemplating getting a puppy, they are the best antidepressant ever, and who doesn't need that in this economy. Everyone should have one!</p>

                        <p>He stands very proud! Most of the time! He is very shy and timid with strangers and strange places. But once he is familiar and comfortable he does much much better. He starts puppy classes on Tuesday! More so for socializing and the basic commands! I’m positive he will do wonderful! Yes, please use us as a reference! If you would like better pictures I am happy to send more! He is a true snuggler at heart. Rody loves his kisses and snuggles. He really is our cute Havanese baby!</p>

                        <p>Love Our Puppy, Not Sure we Loved Our Service <br>    

                        I will say we love our puppy!! Communication at first was fantastic and then it took awhile to get any answers from the them. We got nervous about them being legit, especially after we paid, but they got back in communication with us so we felt better. There were a few hiccups during the process but things were ironed out. Our puppy was about an hour late for drop off. When we opened her cage, our puppy smelled awful and looked and acted as if she came from a puppy mill. Our hearts sank as she was saturated in her own urine. We gave her a bath and took her to the vet. She tested positive for parasites and was sick for her first 2.5 weeks. Ronarld Chetty assured that the puppies are healthy before they’re re handed over but our little one was not. She is doing amazing now and we are so happy but the process was not as smooth as we expected. Everyone was friendly and answered questions for us when they were in communication, we did get a follow up call to switch ownership, so I gave them a 4. Photo attached is after her first groom. I will not post a before.</p>

                        <p>Dean is a wonderful "companion" <br>

                        Dean is a wonderful "companion" Puppy. I
                        was extremely concerned for Dean safety
                        during his travels, he is amazing, he
                        arrived in good condition. However during
                        his vet exam it was descovered she had
                        Giardia. After a week of meds it is gone.
                        Dean is a very good boy and he is really helping me to overcome my depression and disability…Thank you

                        <p>I Just wanted to let you know we are so incredibly in love with Angel!!! She is such a good girl and smart as all get out. She is loving life on the farm, and already trying out her herding skills on the cows, horses, chicken and cats. We never have her on a leash; she listens well and plays outside all day with us while we work about. People give good comments all the time whenever I take her out for a walk. Oh my God, am really glad.</p>

                        <p>Libby is a one of a kind sweet girl. She is very precious &amp; intelligent. She has developed a funny habit of sucking on my earlobe while she lays on her back &amp; lets me rub her belly. She is very outgoing &amp; friendly to everyone. She has gorgeous eyes &amp; she always gives you eye contact when you talk to her. I have never shown in a dog show but Libby is making me seriously consider it. She has such a big personality, that I think she would do well. Her coat is silky, soft &amp; THICK. I can tell she is going to be gorgeous. To anyone who is contemplating getting a puppy, they are the best antidepressant ever, and who doesn't need that in this economy. Everyone should have one!</p>
